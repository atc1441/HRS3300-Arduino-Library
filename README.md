### You can support my work via paypal: https://paypal.me/hoverboard1 this keeps projects like this comming.

It includes a closed source .a file, to get the Arduino IDE recognize it you need to edit the Platform.txt from the nRF52 library.


Add: ```compiler.libraries.ldflags=``` somewhere as a new line.

also add: ```{compiler.libraries.ldflags}``` somewhere ad the end of line ```combine.pattern```
